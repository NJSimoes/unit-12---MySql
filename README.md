# unit-12---MySql

Bootcamp Homework  -  MySql

requirements - need to have MAMP running & the DB loaded from the bamazonSchema.sql file

this is a simple MySql project that acts as an ordering and inventory control app

upon execution the current inventory is displayed

the user is prompted to select the item number he'd like to order and then the quantity he needs

the app then depletes the quantity selected from the item selected and asks the user if he'd like to
order another item 

finally it either redisplays the inventory with updated quantities and starts theordering process over

or exits the app
